// Why do we give semicolons at the end of class?
// Many people might say that itâ€™s a basic syntax 
// and we should give a semicolon at the end of the class as its rule defines in cpp.
// But the main reason why semi-colons are there at the end of the class is compiler checks
// if the user is trying to create an instance of the class at the end of it. 

// Yes just like structure and union,
// we can also create the instance of a class at the end just before the semicolon.
// As a result, once execution reaches at that line,
// it creates a class and allocates memory to your instance.
